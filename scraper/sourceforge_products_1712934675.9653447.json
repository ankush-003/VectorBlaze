Monitor your line in real-time. Let customers safely wait in their car, at home, or outside. Notify them when you are ready to serve them. Give customers regular updates and wait times. Make them feel like VIPs by talking to them directly and asking for their feedback.\n\u2026 Expand \u25be\nLearn More",

Many plug-ins and scripts are already available: you can create web installers, communicate with Windows and other software components, install or update shared components and more.\n79 Reviews\nDownloads: 7,207 This Week\nLast Update: 2024-04-03\nSee Project",

Stereo and mono sound output is supported via a slightly customized version of libsoundio 2.0. Audio clips can have arbitrary channel counts, and can be queued for streaming or dynamic music.
