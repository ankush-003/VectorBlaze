        "description": "Flannel runs a small, single binary agent called flanneld on each host, and is responsible for allocating a subnet lease to each host out of a larger, preconfigured address space. Flannel uses either the Kubernetes API or etcd directly to store the network configuration, the allocated subnets, and any auxiliary data (such as the host's public IP). Packets are forwarded using one of several backend mechanisms including VXLAN and various cloud integrations. Platforms like Kubernetes assume that each container (pod) has a unique, routable IP inside the cluster. The advantage of this model is that it removes the port mapping complexities that come from sharing a single host IP.

The advantage of this model is that it removes the port mapping complexities that come from sharing a single host IP.

Its theme is centered around the concept of converting matter into energy and vice versa, to store and transport your items and fluids instantaneously. AE2 revolutionizes storage in Minecraft. The mod adds a network-based digital storage system, where items and blocks are stored as energy in a digital form within a network of connected devices. This allows for compact storage solutions and easy access to your items. Another significant feature of AE2 is its automatic crafting capabilities. Players can set up patterns and recipes which the system can automatically craft on demand. This greatly streamlines bulk and complex crafting processes, saving time and effort. AE2 adds a whole new level of strategy to your Minecraft builds with its networking and channel system.\nDownloads: 0 This Week\nLast Update: 1 day ago\nSee Project",
